# Val's Vehicles

Val Vorhees runs a successful multi-national corporation that specializes in the fueling and storage of any kind of vehicle. Val has contracted us to build a software program that lets her track all of the kinds of vehicles that she typically deals with. The program should record common properties of each vehicle, record specific trips for each vehicle, allow it to be refueled, a keep a running total of the kilometers traveled by each one.

Also you need to be able to know where each vehicle is stored when not in use.

You need to design a system that is organized and flexible enough to add any kind of new vehicle without the code becoming overwhelmingly noisy and repetitive.

## Getting Started

1. Create a `vals-vehicles` directory.
2. Create a `main.py` file in that directory.
3. Consider the pros and cons of inheritance and composition to define all of the classes that you need to have a flexible system.
4. Make sure you organize your classes into packages.
